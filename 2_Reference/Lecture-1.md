Chapter One: Introduction
A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO HARDWARE,
SOFTWARE, AND ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT

[[Lecture-1#^L1-2]]
Chapter Goals
•In this chapter you will learn:
• About computer hardware, software and programming
• How to write and execute your first Python program
• How to diagnose and fix programming errors
• How to use pseudocode to describe an algorithm

[[Lecture-1#^L1-3]]
Our First Definition
Algorithm:
• An algorithm is a step by step description of how to solve a problem

[[Lecture-1#^L1-4]]
Computer Programs
•A computer program tells a computer the sequence of steps needed to
complete a specific task
• The program consists of a very large number of primitive (simple)
instructions
• Computers can carry out a wide range of tasks because they can
execute different programs
• Each program is designed to direct the computer to work on a specific task
Programming:
• The act of designing, implementing, and testing computer programs

[[Lecture-1#^L1-5]]
Hardware and Software
THE BUILDING BLOCKS THAT MAKE UP A
COMPUTER

[[Lecture-1#^L1-6]]
Hardware
•Hardware consists of the physical elements in a computer system.
• Some very visible examples are the monitor, the mouse, external storage,
and the keyboard.
••The central processing unit (CPU) performs program control and data
processing
Storage devices include memory (RAM) and secondary storage
• Hard disk
• Flash drives
• CD/DVD drives
•Input / output devices allow the user to interact with the computer
• Mouse, keyboard, printer, screen...
